>That day, I closed my eyes in the incense fog of the Buddhaâ€™s Hall, suddenly heard the mantra from your voice;
>
>That month, I turned all the prayer wheels, not for my salvation, but for the touch of your fingertips;
>
>That year, I prostrated myself along the mountain paths, not for my pilgrimage, but for the warmth of being close to you;
>
>That life, I turned around mountains and rivers, I turned around all the Pagodas, not for earning my afterlife, but to meet with you in the way.
